# Validation

Miso supports validating parameters against some pre-defined rules. This is enabled by adding tag `valid` on the fields. The mapped inbound request objects are always validated first before reaching to the handler function.

For example,

```go
type Dummy struct {
  Favourite string `valid:"notEmpty"`
}
```

To validate a struct, we can also use `miso.Validate(...)` as follows:

```go
func TestValidate(t *testing.T) {
  v := Dummy{}
  e := Validate(v)
  if e != nil {
    t.Fatal(e)
  }
}
```

The rules available are (see constants and documentation in `validation.go`):

- maxLen
- notEmpty
- notNil
- positive
- positiveOrZero
- negative
- negativeOrZero
- notZero
- validated

A field can have more than one rule, these rules are sapareted using ',', and the rules are validated in the order in which they are declared, for example:

```go
type ValidatedDummy struct {
  DummyPtr *AnotherDummy `valid:"notNil,validated"`
}
```

The `DummyPtr` field is then validated against rule `notNil` first, and then the rule `validated`.

Some rules require parameters (only `maxLen` for now), these are specified in the format: `[RULE_NAME]:[PARAM]`, for example:

```go
type ValidatedDummy struct {
  Name string `valid:"maxLen:10,notEmpty"`
}
```

This is basically asking that the `Name` field can at most have 10 characters, and it cannot be empty (blank).

Rule `validated` is very special. It doesn't actually check the value of the field, instead, it annotates that the field should be further analyzed recursively. If the field is a pointer and it's not nil, the actual value dereferenced to is validated. If the field is just a simple struct, then the struct is scanned.
